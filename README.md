# Note-Flask_WebApp

This is a Todo Flask Application built on Python Flask Web Framework and deployed on AWS Elasticbean Stalk

To run this application locally just execute the code "app.py"

To deploy on AWS we need to Open AWS Elasticbean Stalk and create an application deployment and upload the "Flask.zip" file in upload code and then our application will be up and running on the AWS server with by default created EC2 instance and with default Security Groups.
